# 🐄 Tambo

This was the final project for the subject **Programming 2** at **Universidad ORT Uruguay**.

📋 **Description**  
Tambo is a desktop application focused on the **management of livestock** and **staff administration**. It allows the user to:

- 🐮 Register and manage cattle.
- 👤 Add and remove personnel.
- ✅ Assign tasks to each person.

💻 **Tech Stack**  
The project was developed using **C# with .NET**, implementing the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** web architecture pattern.

🧠 **MVC Explained**  
The MVC pattern is a widely used software design approach that separates the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model (📦)**: Represents the application's data and business logic. In Tambo, this includes entities such as cattle, employees, and tasks.
- **View (🖥️)**: The user interface. It displays data from the model and sends user interactions to the controller.
- **Controller (🎮)**: Handles user input, works with the model, and decides which view to render. It acts as the intermediary between the model and the view.

⚙️ **Domain Layer**  
Tambo follows an architectural approach that includes a **Domain Layer**.  
This layer is where all the **business logic** resides, along with the **core entities** of the application. It ensures that the rules and behavior of the system are kept **centralized**, **consistent**, and **independent** of infrastructure or external dependencies.

The **Domain Layer** promotes a clean structure and allows easier testing and reusability of the business logic across different contexts.

🚀 Built with the goal of applying real-world application structure, logic, and usability.
